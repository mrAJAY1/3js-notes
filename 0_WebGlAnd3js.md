1. What is WebGL?

- Web Graphics Library is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics for the web without any additional plugins.
  It is based on OpenGL ES.

It uses graphics pipeline process which includes shaders and other technologies. This basically means that the graphics is rendered by creating vertexes and forming lot of triangles.

2. What is 3.js?

- 3js is a library that is built on top of WebGL which makes it easy to create graphics for the web.

Since it is built on top of WebGL, it still allows us to directly interact with WebGL so that we can do more operations in the low level including performance optimizations.

3. What is the difference between a CPU and a GPU?

- A CPU is used for general purposes such as running applications, handling system process and computations that requires high precision and low latency outputs.
- A GPU is used for parallel computations which can run multiple computations in parallel and it excels in running parallel tasks, which makes it best for rendering graphics, machine learning and scientific simulations.
